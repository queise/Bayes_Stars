# Bayes_Stars
Bayesian inference of the posterior probability on stellar mass, age and metallicity using [MultiNest](https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/).

Look at the IPython notebook here:
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/queise/Bayes_Stars/blob/master/DataAnalysis_StarDM.ipynb

Inside the /code folder you will find the python scripts to run Multinest using [OpenMPI](http://www.open-mpi.org/) for parallellization and/or [HTCondor](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/) queue system to run in a cluster. Take a look at 

The Likelihood is calculated
